Following the words of God also means you carry his commands with you. As you carry his commands, you know that you cannot love sin, since sin does not exist where God dwells. If you want to follow the Lord you'll need to confess your sin and surrender your life to him. Proverbs 28:13, says: Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.  This verse makes it clear that you cannot serve the Lord and love sin at the same time; it is impossible to achieve both.",

But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.  James 5:8. You also must be patient. Keep your hopes high, for the day of the Lord's coming is near.

You can think, dream, plan, design, create, and build because you've been given the desire, ability, and some raw materials. So if you want to live a life that matters, a life that leaves an eternal legacy, you must stay connected to the source of life.

Look! the right path is not a path that does not have any obstacles or calamities instead, it is a path that will set you free from the enemy because it will make you strong and know that nothing can destroy you. Be prepare means that you know you will be tested (A true believer must be tested) but because your hope is from the almighty God you'll always be conquered and set free from the enemy.
